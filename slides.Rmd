# A Quantiative Marine Scientist


> I use methods and ideas from ecology, economics, and data science to help understand and manage social-ecological systems. 


I study...
  
  - Fisheries assessment and management
  
  - Social-ecological impacts of policies
  
  - Predictive modeling in social-ecological systems
  
Using ...
 
  - Bayesian methods
 
  - Econometrics
 
  - Open and reproducible data science
  


???

.center[**An Optimistic Skeptic**]


What do I mean by an optimistic skeptic? Social-ecological systems are complicated. This both complicates our ability to clearly understand what is happening in them, and to identify simple solutions to complex problems. Hence, "skeptic": my prior is that uncertainty and complexity are the norm. Optimist though: I believe that science can help us navigate this uncertainty and complexity in a productive way, to help us move slowly towards better understanding and better outcomes.

# Let's Talk About Salmon

.pull-left[

Sockeye salmon (*Oncorhynchus nerka*) play a critical role in 
  
  - Ecosystems
  - Economics
  - Culture

They are also a useful case study in **predictive modeling**
  - Long time series
  - High-quality data
  - Dynamic
  - **Need for forecasts**

# Historic Forecast Strategies

.pull-left[

- Fisheries Research Institute has provided forecasts since at least 1967

- Primary method has been **sibling regression**
  - Predict returns of cohort *this year* by trends in cohort in *previous years*
  

- Challenges
  - What about the youngest age classes?
  - What if maturation schedule changes?

# Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Models

.pull-left[
Historic FRI forecasts have focused on **parametric** models
  - Researchers determine functional forms, model assigns coefficients


**Non-parametric** models flip the problem
  - Models **learn** and fit functional forms to achieve objective

- Omitting useful correlations

---

# Why Non-Parametric Models?


Parametric models can be limited by our imaginations (and patience)
  - Can result in model misspecification

Non-parametric models reduce chance of **predictive model misspecification**
  - If there's a good model to be found, they will find it

Allows us to explore
  - Non-linearities
  - Dynamic responses
  - Environmental correlations

# Models Explored


Random Forests (`ranger`)
  * Ensemble of *independent* regression trees

--

Boosted regression trees (`XGBoost`)
  * Ensemble of regression trees *that build on each other*

--

Recurrent neural networks (`tensorflow`)
  * A neural network *with memory*

--

Dynamic Linear Models (`MARSS`)
  * A hybrid linear regression with non-parametric dynamics

--

Empirical Dynamic Modeling (`rEDM`)
  * Predictions based on lags, predicated on Takens' theorem

--

The Might Lag(1)
  * Returns this year = returns last year

---

# Example Model

Predict returns of age group $a$ to river system *s* as a function of...
  - Historic cohort returns across all systems
  - Historic **non-cohort** returns across all systems
  - Other salmonids (pink, chum)
  - At-sea environmental covariates
    - Temperature 
    - Wind
    - PDO
    - Pressure

---

# Testing Strategy

.pull-left[

Goal is *one-year-ahead* forecasting

For each model... 

1. Tune-and-fit each model to pre-forecast year data

2. Compare performance against lag(1) benchmark

3. Repeat in rolling fashion from 2000 to 2020

4. Construct rolling-ensemble of models over same time period based on historic performance of individual models

# Ensemble Model


- Best-performing individual models reduced system-level RMSE by on average **15%**
  - "If you had picked the best model from 2000 to 2020..."

- But, managers have to decide which model to trust every year

- Historically done by AIC weighting

- We built statistical "model-of-models" to create a performance-weighed ensemble forecasts

**Pre-Season** forecasts support planning by communities and managers

# Why So Many Models?

- In parametric modeling, we often pick models based on **theory**
  - GAM vs. GLM vs. GLMER etc. 

- For regression-style problems little inherent reason for one non-parametric method over another

- Range of models allows us to explore best performers for different tasks
  - And ensemble, for better or worse...
