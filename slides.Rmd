  - **Why** do things happen?
  - **What will** happen?

Ecology has historically focused on the *why*

data-generating vs. algorithmic approaches

part of low main effect is precise estimation of small but important effects

I would argue that a lot though is also a focus on understandable models over predictive models that vastly oversimplify complex systems. 

Important to note if our policy-informing model only explains a small fraction of past variance

Sockeye salmon (*Oncorhynchus nerka*) play a critical role in

They are also a useful case study in **predictive modeling**
  - Long time series

# Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Models

.pull-left[
Historic FRI forecasts have focused on **parametric** models
  - Researchers determine functional forms, model assigns coefficients
  - Sibling regression in this case


**Non-parametric** models flip the problem
  - Models **learn** and fit functional forms to achieve objective

- Omitting useful correlations

---

# Why Non-Parametric Models?


Non-parametric models reduce chance of **predictive model misspecification**
  
  - If there's a good model to be found, they will find it


Non-parametric models can help us explore

  - Non-linearities
  
  - Dynamic responses
  
  - Environmental correlations

That we might otherwise miss

---

# Models Explored

Random Forests (`ranger`)
  * Ensemble of *independent* regression trees

Boosted regression trees (`XGBoost`)
  * Ensemble of regression trees *that build on each other*


Recurrent neural networks (`tensorflow`)<sup>*</sup>
  * A neural network *with memory*


Dynamic Linear Models (`MARSS`)
  * A hybrid linear regression with non-parametric dynamics


Empirical Dynamic Modeling (`rEDM`)
  * Predictions based on lags, predicated on Takens' theorem

# Example Model

Predict returns of age group $a$ to river system $s$ in year $y$ as a function of...
  
  - Historic cohort returns across all systems

  - Historic **non-cohort** returns across all systems

  - Other salmonids (pink, chum)

  - At-sea environmental covariates
    
    - Temperature 
    
    - Wind
    
    - PDO
    
    - Pressure


---

# Testing Strategy

.pull-left[

Goal is *one-year-ahead* forecasting

For each model... 

1. Tune-and-fit each model to pre-forecast year data

2. Compare performance against lag(1) benchmark

3. Repeat in rolling fashion from 2000 to 2020

# Ensemble Model


- Best-performing individual models reduced system-level RMSE by on average **15%**
  - "If you had picked the best model from 2000 to 2020..."

- But, managers have to decide which model to trust every year

- Historically done by AIC weighting

- We built statistical "model-of-models" to create a performance-weighed ensemble forecasts

Remember, non-parameteric models can help us with model misspecification: they can't squeeze information out of data that just isn't there. 

Our initial motivation for this project was "is there a better model out there". Our answer is, "somewhat, but we really need more and better data"

# Improving Sockeye Salmon Forecasts

.pull-left[

Can non-parametric models improve sockeye forecasts? Somewhat.

- Non-parametric models reduced forecast error some 
  * ~13% in 5/7 river systems
  * Revealed importance of cross-system correlations
  * 2022 Forecast: Another **70 million** year... 

- Sometimes we just need more data

- Areas of exploration

  * Size structure

  * Ecosystem drivers

# Forecasting Salmon

Salmon management depends on a variety of forecasts

**Spawner-recruit** models guide management targets

**In-Season** forecasts inform daily fishery decisions
  - Run timing and volume
  
**Pre-Season** forecasts support planning by communities and managers


---

# Why So Many Models?

.pull-left[

- In parametric modeling, we often pick models based on **theory**
  - GAM vs. GLM vs. GLMER etc. 

- For regression-style problems little inherent reason for one non-parametric method over another

- Range of models allows us to explore best performers for different tasks
  - And ensemble, for better or worse...
